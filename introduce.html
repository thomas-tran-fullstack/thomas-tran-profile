      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Trần Bảo Toàn</strong>, born on <strong>November 2</strong>, originally from
        <strong>Sóc Trăng, Việt Nam</strong>. Since <strong>2023</strong>, I have been living, studying,
        and working in <strong>Cần Thơ</strong> as an international programming student.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a strong passion for technology and continuous improvement, I aim to become a highly skilled and
        adaptable <strong>Fullstack Developer</strong> capable of solving real-world problems and building impactful
        digital solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was exposed to computers and English at an early age, shaping my mindset, discipline, and professional
        direction. I always strive to improve myself — becoming better than who I was yesterday.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths</h2>

      <h3>Exceptional English Ability</h3>
      <p>
        I started learning English at age 8, trained professionally at 16, and communicated with foreign customers
        during my part-time work. This strengthened my communication, pronunciation, and confidence.
      </p>

      <h3>Teamwork & Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        I work efficiently in group environments while respecting team structure. Teamwork to me means communication,
        clarity, responsibility, and shared commitment.
      </p>

      <h3>Problem-Solving Mindset</h3>
      <p>
        I handle issues immediately with a logical and structured approach, always completing tasks professionally.
      </p>

      <h3>Fast Learning & Adaptability</h3>
      <p>
        I quickly understand new technologies, adapt well to environments, and learn continuously.
      </p>

      <h3>Discipline & Resilience</h3>
      <p>
        I stay focused under pressure and maintain productivity. My mindset: “Grow stronger. Learn faster.”
      </p>

      <h3>Communication & Extroversion</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy connecting and communicating with people — useful in Fullstack development.
      </p>

      <h2>Weaknesses</h2>

      <h3>Perfectionist Tendencies</h3>
      <p>I sometimes focus too much on detail. Improving daily.</p>

      <h3>Taking Too Many Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>I often take extra tasks, but it helps me grow.</p>

      <h3>Overly Direct Communication</h3>
      <p>I’m straightforward, which avoids misunderstandings but may sound strict.</p>

      <h2>Communication Skills</h2>
      <p>I communicate clearly in both English and Vietnamese.</p>

      <h2>Language Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vietnamese:</strong> Native</li>
        <li><strong>English:</strong> Advanced</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Teamwork Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>High responsibility</li>
        <li>Strong collaboration</li>
        <li>Excellent task coordination</li>
        <li>Respect for structure</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Office & Computer Skills</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Microsoft Office</li>
        <li>Fast typing</li>
        <li>Hardware knowledge</li>
        <li>Experienced with computers since young</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why I Chose Fullstack Development</h2>
      <p>
        Fullstack is essential in today’s digital world — especially in Việt Nam where many businesses lack strong IT.
      </p>
      <p>
        It allows me to build complete solutions, combining frontend and backend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology is a tool to create meaningful opportunities.
